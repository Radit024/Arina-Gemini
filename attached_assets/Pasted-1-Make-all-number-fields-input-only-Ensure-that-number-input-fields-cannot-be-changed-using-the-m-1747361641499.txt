1.	Make all number fields input-only:
Ensure that number input fields cannot be changed using the mouse scroll.
2.	Ensure correct formula for Business Feasibility Analysis
3.	Add information buttons (i) beside all elements in the feature sidebar:
For each of the following:
o	Business Feasibility Analysis
o	Demand Forecasting
o	Optimization Analysis
o	Smart Recommendations
o	Analysis History
Add a tooltip-style (i) button that displays a pop-up on mouse hover, explaining what that feature does (e.g., “Investment Cost is the total upfront cost required for the project…”).
4.	Refactor all code if possible:
Perform general code cleanup:
o	Remove redundant logic
o	Improve readability
o	Fix any runtime or logic errors
o	Ensure consistent and modern code practices (e.g., React/TSX best practices, modularity)
5.	Add (i) tooltips beside elements (including fields):
Include formula descriptions, purpose of input/output, and how results are calculated. These tooltips should appear on hover.
6.	Add calculation explanations:
o	Provide inline or modal-based explanations for each result.
o	Include formulas used, assumptions, and description of each output metric.
7.	Refactor Gemini API integration logic:
o	Avoid looping/duplicated responses.
o	Improve prompt structuring and response validation.
o	Ensure the behavior mimics actual Gemini-like functionality (i.e., concise, direct, and context-aware answers).
o	Add logic to stop generation at appropriate points.
8.	Remove the blinking cursor typing effect from generative AI:
For a better UX, remove the animation that mimics typing (especially if it's causing performance or readability issues).
9.	Turn the specific element into an “About This Project” button:
•	When clicked, it should open a modal or section with placeholder content describing the project.
•	Placeholder can say:
"This platform helps users perform advanced business analysis using AI-assisted tools, including demand forecasting, feasibility studies, and smart recommendations."
10.	Ensure all proposed changes are implemented:
Conduct testing and QA to verify that every item in this list is working as expected.
